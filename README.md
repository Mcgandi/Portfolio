## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a cybersecurity enthusiast transitioning from the power and energy sector into IT security, with a strong foundation in diagnostics, data analysis and reliability engineering of industrial systems. My experience in monitoring critical infrastructure and working with ICS/SCADA systems has sparked a deep interest in protecting such environments from cyber threats.

Currently, I'm building my cybersecurity skills through certifications, threat intelligence training and hands-on tools like Suricata and Splunk. I'm particularly passionate about threat detection, risk analysis and critical infrastructure protection.

I aim to specialize in industrial cybersecurity (ICS/OT), cyber threat intelligence and ultimately take on leadership roles such as CISO. I'm open to junior/mid roles in SOC, CTI or cybersecurity engineering that allow me to apply my technical background and grow as a security professional.
